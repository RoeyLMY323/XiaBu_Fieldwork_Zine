Xiabu · The Social Life of a Factory
A critically engaged zine exploring craft, material life, and fieldwork in Rongchang, Chongqing.

This repository hosts the online version of the zine Xiabu: The Social Life of a Factory, created as part of the Critically Engaged course. The project follows a movement between plant, craft, factory, policy, and embodied knowledge, tracing how a material continues its life through bodies, rhythms, and labor.

📘 Project Overview

Xiabu (ramie summer cloth) is not only a textile but a social material shaped by:
